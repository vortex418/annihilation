**DEVELOPER MODIFICATION TO LICENSE**

If you are modding the game, please first join the dsicord (https://discord.gg/ZyTsVR4NCV), 
and direct message or @mention me. Modded versions of the game MUST be hosted in this repository.

*Modding Guidelines*

Again, if you are modding the game, please follow the following standards:

1. Your modded version of the game can't contain any malicous code
2. Any and all externally used code libraries must be either offical (such as a processing.js library from cloudflare), or already hosted in this repository.
3. You must have a developers permission (anyone with the @Dev role in the discord) before you post a moddifed version of the game.
4. If you want to add a code library or media, please @mention or direct message a game developer.
